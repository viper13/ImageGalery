# ImageGalery
Carousel image gallery

# Build
Project configuret under CMake and QT.
I have used Qt Creator with QT SDK 6.7.0
Using another version must not lead to the errors. But better use this one.

# Run
For right application working it need internet access to the https://cdn-media.brightline.tv/dev/templates/image_gallery_exercise.json

# Dependecies
QT SDK 6.7.0
